# node-activerecord

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/meltingice/node-activerecord.png?branch=refactoring)](http://travis-ci.org/meltingice/node-activerecord)

An ORM written in Coffeescript that supports multiple database systems (SQL, NoSQL, and even REST), as well as ID generation middleware. It is fully extendable to add new database systems and plugins.

**This branch is undergoing what is basically a complete rewrite. When this is more feature complete, it will be merged with the master branch and development will continue as normal.**
